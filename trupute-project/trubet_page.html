      <p><strong>Jabir ibn Hayyan</strong> (<em>c. eighth and early ninth centuries</em> ) was an Islamic thinker from the early medieval period to whom is ascribed authorship of a large number of alchemical, practical, and philosophical works. Many of these works were translated and distributed throughout the learning centers of medieval Europe under the latinized form of Jabir's name, Geber. Whether or not he was genuinely the author of all the works attributed to him, his contributions were substantial, laying the foundations of modern chemistry.</p>

      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Jabir Ibn Hayyan was born in Tus, Persia in c. 721 and died in c. 815. His ninety four years life was devoted thoroughly to science and the quest for knowledge. Whether he was an Arab who lived in Khorasan or a Perisan who later traveled to Kufa in Iraq remains an unanswered question; ambiguity still surrounds his ethnic origin. After the execution of his father for having supported the Abbasids against the Omayyads during their struggle for power, he was sent from Kufa to his relatives in Arabia –Yemen- where he was raised and taught the Qur’an, maths and other subjects.</p>
      <p>When the Abbasids dynasty toppled down the Omayyads and took power, Jabir went back to Baghdad, the capital city of the Abbasids, where he served as a favored alchemist in the court of the famous Abassid Caliph Harun al-Racheed. Because of his strong relationship with the Barmakids who threatened the power of the Caliph Harun al-Racheed, Jabir was banished together with the Barmekids and he returned back to Kufa where he remained until his death.</p>

      <h3>Contributions to chemistry</h3>
      <p>It is useful to differentiate the techniques, processes, and theories associated with the Arabic works ascribed to Jabir, and those of the Latin works under the authorship of Geber, Jabir's latinized name.</p>
      <h4>Jabirian contributions include:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The importance of practical knowledge gained from experience and experiment.</li>
        <li>A broadening of the scope of investigation of materials to include not just minerals, but also plant and animal substances.</li>
        <li>The importance of number in an understading of the universe. The numbers 17 and 28 bear a particular significance in Jabir's system.</li>
        <li>The principle of balance in assessing the properties of substances, which can mean their actual densities or their part in the composition of other substances.</li>
        <li>The introduction of the qualities of warm, cold, moist and dry, in addition to the ancient Greek categories or elements of fire, water, earth and air.</li>
        <li>The possibility of the artificial production of many naturally occuring entities and phenomena, including life itself.</li>
        <li>and more</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Contributions to alchemy</h3>
      <p>Jabir's alchemical investigations ostensibly revolved around the ultimate goal of the artificial creation of life.<em> The Book of Stones</em> includes several recipes for creating creatures such as<strong> scorpions, snakes, and even humans</strong> in a laboratory environment, which are subject to the control of their creator.</p>
      <p>Ibn Hayyan was deeply religious, and repeatedly emphasized in his works that alchemy is possible only by subjugating oneself completely to the will of Allah and becoming a literal instrument of Allah on Earth, since the manipulation of reality is possible only for Allah. The Book of Stones prescribes long and elaborate sequences of specific prayers that must be performed without error alone in the desert before one can even consider alchemical experimentation.</p>
